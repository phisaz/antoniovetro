        abstract = {Context OpenCoesione is the first portal about the fulfilment of investments and projects planned by the Italian central government and by the Italian Regions using the 2007?2013 European Cohesion funds. Together with Monithon, it is a "transparency tool" whose aim is to foster participation of the citizens and efficiency of the public sector bodies in order to improve the implementation of development policies. By now it is one of the best Open Data portal in Italy quality?wise. Objective Our goal is to show the utility of these portals, how this open information is supposed to help the civil society and how data quality might affect reuse. Method We engage in the empirical observation on how data are exposed and used, discussing specific examples, and applying some data quality metrics. Results We present some evidences on how open data can positively affect the public sector bodies and the spending of funds. Conclusions Under?spending of EU Cohesion funds is a serious problem in Italy. OpenCoesione and Monithon can contribute solving this inefficiency, e.g., by presenting data in such a (standardised) way to enable their elaboration by third parties}
